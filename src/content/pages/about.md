### About

I'm a law student at Georgetown University Law Center working at the intersection of public policy, tech governance, and politics. The challenge that drives my work is bringing people together who see the world differently—people who have competing values, different information sources, and disagreements about what matters most—to cooperate and make collective decisions for the common good. The defining issues of our time, including governing artificial intelligence, responding to climate change, and strengthening democratic institutions, require us to work together. And through years of personal experience navigating seemingly irreconcilable conflicts, I've come to understand that progress often comes not from "winning" but from patient engagement, humility, and willingness to understand other perspectives.

This website is where I think things through, tell stories that illustrate my principles, and try to contribute something useful to conversations that matter. I take inspiration from the following:
